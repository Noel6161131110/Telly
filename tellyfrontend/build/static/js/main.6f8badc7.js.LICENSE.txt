 *
 * `nanoid` is currently only distributed as an ES module. Some tools (jest, playwright) don't
 * properly support ESM-only code yet, and tldraw itself is distributed as both an ES module and a
 * CommonJS module. By including nanoid here, we can make sure it works well in every environment
 * where tldraw is used. We can also remove some unused features like custom alphabets.
